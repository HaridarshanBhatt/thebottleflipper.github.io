<p>1. Start with a clear, empty bottle.</p>
<p>2. Fill the bottle ¼ - 1/3 full of water. You can eyeball this part if you want, but if you don’t get the water level right, the bottle may not land correctly.</p>
<p>3. Set the bottle on a flat surface, such as a table or desk. The surface that you flip your bottle from and on which it lands needs to be flat, so it can land evenly.</p>
<p>4. Grip the bottle between your fingertips and thumb on its neck near the cap. Place your fingertips and thumb around the top of the neck of the bottle so that your hand is hovering over, but not touching, the cap.</p>
<p>5. Flick your wrist up and away from you while gripping the bottle. Leave the bottom of your bottle on the flat surface. Grip the bottle tightly in your fingers as you flick your wrist up quickly.</p>
<p>6. Let go of the bottle when its bottom is in the air. When your wrist is as high as it can go, the bottom of the bottle should be about halfway up the first half of its flip.</p>
<p>7.  Watch the bottle land back on its bottom. If you did the flip correctly, the bottle should do a single rotation in the air in a clockwise direction, and land right-side up on its bottom. Continue practicing and flipping the bottle until you can get it to land on its bottom multiple times in a row.</p>
